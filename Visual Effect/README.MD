🌙 DeepDream Image Generator ✨


I'm currently practicing TensorFlow by following along with the YouTube tutorial https://youtu.be/MrBzgvUNr4w?si=qJTfHgWbs9Rht9y8 and adding my own twists to the code. 💻📚

🚀 Getting Started
Requirements 🛠️
To run the script, you'll need to install the following Python libraries:
tensorflow
numpy
PIL (Pillow)
matplotlib

Run this command to install them:
pip install tensorflow numpy pillow matplotlib scipy


🖼️ What It Does
The script generates 3 versions of your image, each with different iteration counts (10, 50, 100), resulting in a unique visual effect every time!
These images are saved in the deepdream_output folder:

original.jpg – The original input image.
deepdream_iter10.jpg – Dreamy image with 10 iterations.

deepdream_iter50.jpg – Dreamy image with 50 iterations.

deepdream_iter100.jpg – Dreamy image with 100 iterations.
